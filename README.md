UERANSIM (pronounced "ju-i ræn sɪm"), is the open-source state-of-the-art 5G UE and RAN (gNodeB) implementation. The project can be used for testing 5G Core Network and studying 5G System.

## Current Status
Our UE and gNodeB are functional and ready to use. You can connect them to your 5G core network right now and start using it. 

At the same time, NR radio interface is under development but not complete yet. Currently we utilize the radio interface over a simulated environment.
